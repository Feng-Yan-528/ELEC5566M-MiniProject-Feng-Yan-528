# ELEC5566M-MiniProject-Feng-Yan-528
The project's primary function is: after the host presses the start button, the second countdown begins, and one of the three people needs to rush to answer within a specified time of 15 seconds. After the rush answer is successful, the digital tube shows that the player's number is returned to zero at the same time. If no one rushes to answer within 15 seconds, it will be regarded as giving up, and the seconds will automatically return to zero. After the answer, the host will judge whether it is right or wrong, and the LT24 will show whether the result of the answer is right or wrong. The overall operation sequence is shown in figure 1.1.
